American uses FMS Engine Failure Procedures for takeoff.Engine Failure
Procedures are used at airports with difficult terrain or departure issues such as
Reno(KRNO),Washington DC(KDCA),San Francisco(KSFO),San Diego
(KSAN)among many that have these procedures.The procedure is listed in the
Jepp app under the Company (CO)pages.They will be named RWY TO
This lists the runway and shows it is a takeoff procedure for which aircraft.
For SAN runway 09 they use RWY 09 TO ALL AIRCRAFT.This reads as
Runway 09 Takeoff All Aircraft.For KDCA they use RWY 01 TO A32F.This
shows it is a procedure for Runway 01 Takeoff for the A320 Family(A319,320,
321).This procedure will be named at the top of the page using AA and the
runway if the procedure is available as an FMS procedure.For example at Reno
the procedure is AA34L for runway 34L.
You should select SEC F-PLN,then INIT and enter the departure airport for both
airport codes.For example for Reno enter KRNO/KRNO.Then select the runway
in the SEC F-PLN and use the Engine Failure Procedure as the departure(SID)
This will make the procedure available if you have engine failure on takeoff.Just
have the PM select the SEC FLT PLAN and ACTIVATE it.You can then easily fly
the Engine Failure Procedure on managed autopilot.
Not all procedures have an FMS departure built.You may want to use the FIX
INFO page to build a reference on the PFD.For example at KSAN you could use
a radius of 7 nm from MZB to build a reference circle for the turn at MZB D7.0 to
turn to heading 220.
At KPHX you can build the departure using fixes that are already built and made.
Just use the names they give.For example runway 08 uses fixes of PHX01 and
PHX02 while runway 07L uses PHX03 and PHX04
Note:American does not build separate procedures into the FMGC for Engine
Failure on Missed Approach.If a procedure is listed for Missed Approach(MA)it
typically will be the same as the takeoff procedure.There is a separate engine
failure procedure for missed approach you will normally have to load the takeoff
procedure.This means you will have to load the arrival city just as you did the
departure city in the SEC F-PLN.For example if you are flying from PHX to RNO
you would enter KRNO/KRNO in the SEC F-PLN to initialize it.Then enter the
procedure as listed.You may need to DELETE the current SEC F-PLN if you had
one already loaded for a different airport.Do not use the CLR key to try to
change the airport codes.Just use the DELETE command.
